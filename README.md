# Word-Guess-Game

This is the first Javascript Assignment for Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.

It is a single page Word Guess game with a Pokemon Theme.  It uses an onkeypress event listener to take in user keyboard input and compare it against words in an array.  When the user correctly the Pokemon name, a "Good Job Trainer!" message appears on screen (and the "new item" sound from the original Pokemon Blue/Red plays).  Should the user run out of their 10 guesses an "Aw, try again..." message appears (and the traditional trumpet Womp, womp, womp sound plays).  If the user guesses 5 Pokemon names correctly, a "YOU WIN!!!" message takes up the whole screen to siginify the game is over (and a snippet of the Pokemon TV Show plays).
